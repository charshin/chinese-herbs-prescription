# Front-end Models

These `models` are used in the front-end. They dictate the shape or data requirements in the
front-end which APIs must adhere to in their data transforming process. This follows the principle
of `SoC`, i.e. Separation of Concern, to keep the integrity of the front-end should there be any API
changes.
